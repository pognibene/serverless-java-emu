# The Serverless API Java emulator
This project emulates AWS API Gateway and AWS lambda, for Java based Lambdas.
It enables fast and convenient testing of your APIs, both locally on your computer and also remotely after deployment.

# Installation
The Serverless API Java emulator (aka SAJ) is available on the maven central repository, so using it is 
a matter of including 1 dependency in your tests:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.agileandmore</groupId>
    <artifactId>com.agileandmore.slsemulator</artifactId>
    <version>1.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
``` 
and one dependency in your production code:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.agileandmore</groupId>
    <artifactId>com.agileandmore.slsruntime</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
``` 
If you would like to compile SAJ yourself:
```shell script
cd sls-runtime
mvn clean install
cd ../sls-emulator
mvn clean install
```
However, be aware that this will result in snapshot versions, so you'll have to adapt the pom files.
# Usage
As SAJ is meant to be used as part of a testing strategy, the best place to get started is the
[WIKI](https://github.com/pognibene/serverless-java-emu/wiki) and then follow with the [Tutorial](https://github.com/pognibene/serverless-java-emu/wiki/Tutorial).
