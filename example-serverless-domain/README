This example makes use of the serverless domain manager plugin,
used to deploy services under a fixed domain name.
The emulator reads the plugin custom entries in the serverless.yml file
and makes sure that the URL are prefixed properly.
This is useful if you run your services locally (using a fake test as a runner,
please also find an example in this project...) and you don't want to modify
your client application to remove the prefix when running locally. Only the
domain name will have to change (ie replaced by http://localhost:port)
